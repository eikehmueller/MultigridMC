/** @class ShiftedLaplaceOperator
 *
 * Class for finite difference discretisation of shifted biharmonic operator
 *
 *     (-alpha_K * Laplace + alpha_b)^2 u
 *   = alpha_K^2 Laplace^2(u) -2 * alpha_K * alpha_b Laplace(u) + alpha_b^2 u
 *
 *
 * with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions u(x)=0, du/dn(x)=0 on the boundary.
 *
 * The finite difference stencils for the Laplace operator and of the squared Laplace operator are
 * given in two dimensions by
 *
 *
 *                                                 C'
 *                                                 !
 *                                                 !
 *             c                            D ---- B' --- D
 *             !                            !      !      !
 *             !                            !      !      !
 *      b ---- a ---- b              C ---- B ---- A ---- B ---- C
 *             !                            !      !      !
 *             !                            !      !      !
 *             c                            D ---- B' --- D
 *                                                 !
 *                                                 !
 *                                                 C'
 *
 * With
 *
 *    a = -2 * (1/h_x^2 + 1/h_y^2)
 *    b = 1/h_x^2
 *    c = 1/h_y^2
 *
 *    A  = 6 * (1/h_x^4 + 1/h_y^4) + 8/(h_x^2*h_y^2)
 *    B  = -4/h_x^2 * (1/h_x^2 + 1/h_y^2)
 *    B' = -4/h_y^2 * (1/h_x^2 + 1/h_y^2)
 *    C  = 1/h_x^4
 *    C' = 1/h_y^4
 *    D  = 2/(h_x^2*h_y^2)
 *
 * inside the domain. At the boundary of the domain, the stencil needs to be modified to
 *
 *                        C'
 *                        !
 *                        !
 *      c                 B' --- D
 *      !                 !      !
 *      !                 !      !
 *      a ---- b         A+C --- B ---- C
 *      !                 !      !
 *      !                 !      !
 *      c                 B' --- D
 *                        !
 *                        !
 *                        C'
 *
 * Note that at the boundary the discretisation has an O(1/h) error [2], i.e.
 *
 *   D_4 u = Laplace^2 u + O(1/h).
 *
 * This error can be reduced to O(h) by replacing A+C -> A + 6C, B -> B-2C, C->C+1/3 C, but the
 * resulting operator is non-symmetric, which is why this approach is not chosen here. The idea for
 * deriving this expression is to use a quartic extrapolation x^2*(a+b*x+c*x^2) to extrapolate the
 * ghost point outside the domain. In [2] an alternative approach is described, which uses a cubic
 * extrapolation to obtain an O(1) error is described.
 *
 * The biharmonic equation discretised with finite differences is solved with multigrid methods in [3-6].
